            <p style="text-align: justify;"> The Mid-Autumn Festival, also known as the Moon Festival or the Mooncake Festival, is a traditional festival celebrated primarily in East Asian countries, especially China, Vietnam, Taiwan, and Singapore. Its origins date back over 3,000 years to ancient China during the Shang dynasty, when people worshipped the moon for bountiful harvests. The festival is celebrated on the 15th day of the 8th lunar month, when the moon is believed to be at its fullest and brightest. The Mid-Autumn Festival is associated with the legend of Chang'e, the Moon Goddess, who is said to have taken an elixir of immortality and ascended to the moon, leaving her husband, Hou Yi, behind on Earth. </p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;"> Over time, the festival has evolved from a harvest celebration to one that emphasizes family reunions, symbolized by the roundness of the full moon. Traditional customs include eating mooncakes, a pastry filled with sweet or savory fillings, and gazing at the moon. Lanterns are also lit and displayed, particularly by children. Today, the Mid-Autumn Festival remains a time for families to come together, celebrate the harvest, and enjoy cultural performances, making it one of the most important traditional festivals in Chinese culture. </p>
